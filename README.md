Most of this code was provided by the University of Texas at Austin Bootcamp curriculum.  Another note to add regarding this code--there is not much room for code variability while using the webpack and the IDB packages.  THEREFORE, a good amount of this repo contains alot of identifical code snippets from other places.  Credit is extended to the following...<br><br>
